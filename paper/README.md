**"JuaPesa: Bridging Mobile Money Fragmentation with AI-Driven Liquidity Networks"**

**Authors**: 
- Augustine Chibueze (First Author) - Backend/AI Engineer
- Adachukwu Okafor (Second Author) - Frontend Engineer

## 📄 Paper Overview

This paper presents JuaPesa, an innovative AI-driven liquidity network that enables near-instant, low-cost transfers between different mobile money systems through intelligent stablecoin routing. The system combines time-series forecasting, reinforcement learning, and large language models to predict liquidity demand and automatically rebalance stablecoin pools.

### Key Contributions

- **Novel Architecture**: Hybrid system combining mobile money APIs, blockchain settlement, and AI-driven liquidity management
- **Intelligent Routing**: Time-series forecasting and reinforcement learning for optimal pool rebalancing
- **Real-World Implementation**: Production-ready system with comprehensive testing and compliance
- **Accessibility Focus**: USSD interface ensuring feature phone compatibility
- **Economic Impact**: Demonstrated 90%+ cost reductions and 99%+ settlement time improvements
